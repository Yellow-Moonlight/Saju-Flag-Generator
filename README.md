## Discover Your Saju Energy Flag

Saju, or the Four Pillars of Destiny, is a traditional Korean system that analyzes your birth date and time to reveal your personal energy balance.
It is based on the Five Elements—Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water—which represent different types of energy and traits.
Each person has a unique mix of these elements, and imbalance can affect your personality, emotions, and life path.
Our program reads your Saju and identifies which elements are strong, weak, or missing.
Then, it creates a personalized "Energy Flag"—a visual symbol that calms excessive energy and boosts what you lack.
The design also highlights your core energy based on your Day Pillar, the most important part of your Saju.
For example, if your main energy is Fire, your flag may include red tones and flame-like shapes to support your spirit.
This simple visual guide helps you reflect on your strengths and balance your energy in daily life.
Try it now and see what your birth reveals!
